## Contributing

We're always happy to receive improvements and fixes, so please submit them whenever you can! A few key points are listed below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Many feature additions are more suitable for plugins, instead of being added to the core.  This is aimed to reduce the future maintenance burden/cost on the maintainers.

If we deny your PR for this reason, please do consider publishing a plugin, and we'll be happy to add it to the [list.md](plugins/list.md "mention")! See [making-a-plugin](plugins/making-a-plugin/ "mention") for more information.
{% endhint %}

* **If your PR will add a major or breaking change, please discuss it with us first, via the Issue Tracker**\
  We don't want to waste your time if we think it's more appropriate for a plugin, and it helps to make a clear plan before starting work
* **Create a draft PR as soon as work starts, and take it out of draft status when ready for review**\
  Keep everyone in the loop, so no-one tries working on the same thing as you
* **Don't change the package version, GitHub workflows, lints, or any other meta files without clarification**\
  We rely on a standardized process and procedure to ensure top-quality releases
* **Use a clear (preferably** [**Conventional**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)**) PR title**\
  This makes it easier for us to group commits for release and write correct CHANGELOGs
